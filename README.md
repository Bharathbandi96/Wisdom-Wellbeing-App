## 🌱 Future Work

If given more time, I would:
- Integrate with a **backend API** (REST) for dynamic data
- Expand test coverage for components and edge cases  
- Add small video links for users to watch related content
- Create detailed category pages with proper descriptions and resources
- Add a save or bookmark feature for favorite resources
